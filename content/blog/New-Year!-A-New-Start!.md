### 2016 A Hero & A Villan

As always, the year started with its own set of twists and turns :wink:. All the expectations that I had towards the year were crushed in the first few months one after the other. After all my expectations crushed, I should have stopped there. But I had other ideas, I thought of rising up from the ashes like a **Phoenix**:sunglasses:. Its wasn't long, before the Phoenix was kicked to the place it came from :expressionless:. The worst thing about the Phoenix was it tried to work solo, barring all social connections. With the Phoenix, I lost myself. 

Then, there came a bunch of people who change the way everything were! People from unexpected places. Some looked me up for what I'm :smile:. Some kicked me for what I'm not :tired_face:. Both made me to be what I'm today. All those expectations which was turned to disappointments, created opportunities. Now I realize that those opportunities were worth the disappointments.

Because of the ***Damn Phoenix***, I made a few irreparable damages. Hope those damages will be fruitful for them! ***Breaking down is Good! Getting up is Better! Going on will lead you towards being the Best!***

With the new opportunities there comes a lot more responsibilities. Embrace the Pain and Loss. For the past few days, I have been thinking of the accomplishing my expectation of 2016 in 2017. Improving my communication skill is one such thing! Writing this blog is towards that. A small step towards my goals :blush:.

***I thank all those People who made me stronger and made me realize who I'm. Sorry for all the damages caused by me intentionally or accidentally.***
