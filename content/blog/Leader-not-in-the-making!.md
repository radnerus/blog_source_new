**December 23, 2004**, still I remember the day when a man with long hair came to the crease, who made me feel sorry for him, after being runout for a duck in his ODI debut. That was the time when many like me wanted a stable wicketkeeper for our team! I was praying him to be the one. He was much more than I ever imagined him :sunglasses:. Then came the knock against Pakistan, that magnificent 148 - thanks to DADA for the belief! There started a new reign in Indian Cricket. Then the Duo joined Dhoni - Yuvi and literally chased everything! Those days were glorious :heart:. 

### The Beginning
Squad for WC 2007 T20i squad announced, I was literally broken down to find Jammy and Sachin not in it. I decided not watch the matches as my heros weren't selected:unamused:. Damn! cable operators discovered my thoughts. First match between Ind vs Pak wasn't telecasted. I remember the day, I was sent for an errand by mom and I stood in front of a TV showroom watching Indian wickets tremble. Damn you, Asif!:rage: 

I returned home stone hearted, cursing the selectors. The next morning I woke up to see my captain raise. That day I flipped through all news channels, to see the bowl out, literally spend the whole day watching it over and over again. That WC was full of moments. We were under-dogs throughout, even though we reached the finals.

### The Glory
**September 24, 2007**, It was the day of finals. Myself with a few friends, bunked our tuitions and we were glued to TV hours before the start. That was a rollercoaster ride:heart_eyes:! Gautham hitting one of his best knocks, Misbah's brilliant stand, Umar's quick fire knock, etc., But everything came down to "***Experts would have told to me to go with the lead spinner. But, I had other ideas***" moment. 

Then came the Might CSK, glorified by Dhoni. Succeeded Jammy and Jumbo as ODI and Test captain respectively. No. 1 Test team, ODI World Cup and almost won all the major trophies. 

### The Captain
I never intend to say Dhoni is the best Batsman, Finisher, Keeper nor he is the wisest of the lot. But the package he provides, none could afford. **We need a trustworthy Keeper, he entered scene! We need a winning captain, he stepped forward! We wished for more trophies, he granted them! Finally we find a more aggressive one, He steps aside.** This is Dhoni for you - The Captain I Love! :heart:
