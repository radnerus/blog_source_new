Human brain is Crazy, High-functioning Super-Computer! It never ceases to judge the working of thing around. But the part which drive the brain crazy is, the mechanism always remain a complete mystery!:confused: Brain can't withstand a mystery, it starts its own ***Negative Impact Analysis***. 

![Thoughts and Actions](/img/thoughts.jpg)

Brain has two choices, to wait till the end to know the result of siuation or assume the worst. As we all know, we tend to do the latter, mostly :smiley:. 

Assuming the worst isn't always bad. But being a little positive would do a loads of wonders. As we are nearing the end of this year, ***Think a little more positve, put it in action and say eeeeeeee*** :grin: ***on every chance you get.***

### Have a great end to 2017 and get ready to rock 2018 like a boss :sunglasses:.
