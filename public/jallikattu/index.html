As a kid growing up in Chennai, I literally don&rsquo;t hear about this tradition all through the year, except on Maatu Pongal while flipping through channels I see a bull raging through in the TV. As many, I too wanted to know more about it. But it is postponed to this very day to dig up some facts.</p>

<h3 id="origin">Origin</h3>

<p>First of all, the name Jallikattu is not the proper one, the original name of the game is <strong>YaeruThazhuval</strong> (ஏறுதழுவல்) which means <strong>bull cuddling/holding</strong> or <strong>Manju viratuthal</strong> (மஞ்சு விரட்டுதல்), later it was changed to Jallikattu(சல்லிக்கட்டு/ஜல்லிக்கட்டு), which means &ldquo;Jalli&rdquo;+&ldquo;Kattu&rdquo;, which refers to the gold or silver coins which will be tied around the bull&rsquo;s neck or on the horns.</p>

<p>We all know bulls help a great deal in agriculture. But, they are so strong and even have the capacity to win over the lion, if a it is, all raged up. By this, the olden Tamil people, being as the brave Tamil lineage, to show their bravery they started a sport, which helps to show case a person&rsquo;s bravery and strength and this was also a criteria for choosing a champion of the kingdom and its army. Also the Undefeated Bulls were the pride of the locality. Its like both the Honorable men in the army and the Bulls were treated equally.</p>

<h3 id="rules-regulations">Rules &amp; Regulations</h3>

<p><img src="http://localhost:1313/img/kaalai-1.jpg" alt="kaalai" />
Bulls are brought to the arena the previous day and tied in coconut groves around the village. Fodder is brought along and water is provided by the host villagers. Sometimes fodder is also provided. A team of veterinarians, animal welfare officials inspect the bulls and give a medical certificate. Before the event starts, they are lined up in batches of 15 close to the rear side of the vaadi vaasal.</p>

<p>After the temple bull of the host village has left the arena, each bull is taken into the vaadi vaasal, where Animal Welfare officers are present. The nose rope of the bull is cut and the bull is free to run. Young bulls and untrained ones participating for the first few times hesitate to leave the vaadi and are prodded by their owners. It is not easy to move them as they weigh anywhere between 250-350 kilos. The experienced bulls (which have long memories) are familiar with jallikattu events and offer their head to the owners to cut the rope. They plan their exit from the vaadi vaasal and time their jump to avoid the players. These are intelligent animals and have evolved in this environment over millennia.</p>

<p>The sport consists of holding on to the hump of the bull and running along with it for a given distance usually about 20-30 meters which is covered in barely 10-20 seconds. Although a few hundred players are present in the arena, only 2-3 attempt to get close to the bull and only 1 has a shot at grabbing the hump. Everything happens so fast that most players hit the dirt and the bulls go free.</p>

<p>After leaving the arena, they go to a barricaded collection area of about 44,000 sq. ft. where experienced herders await the owners. Owners follow the bulls from the vaadi into the collection arena, this takes about 5-10 minutes. Once they enter, the herders help the owners rope in the bulls and take them out of the collection arena. 1-2 bulls will refuse to be roped and charge at everyone, some of them jump out of the collection area and make a run for it. Most of them head in the direction of their villages. There is the occasional injury due to the bulls not being roped.</p>

<h3 id="current-trend">Current Trend</h3>

<p>Considering we were the people who ranked our military with their skill against the Bulls and treat them as Gods, we are the World&rsquo;s largest exporter of Beef (<a href="http://beef2live.com/story-world-beef-exports-ranking-countries-0-106903">Source</a>). There were 130 or so cattle breeds in India 100 years ago and now there are only 37. Unless we engage with the traditional livestock keepers and support them, we will lose these breeds as well as lay the ground for commercial cattle based dairies and slaughter houses to dominate the country</p>

<p>Tamil Nadu had six cattle breeds earlier and now we have lost the Alambadi breed. The remaining breeds are Kangayam, Pulikulam, Umbalachery, Barugur and Malai Maadu. There are a few more minor breeds without proper documentation or care.</p>

<h3 id="a-ban-will-be-fatal">A Ban will be Fatal</h3>

<p>Under the Convention on Biological Diversity and heritage status practices worldwide, it is customary that these ancient traditional practices are left as they are but with rules to organise and regulate them.</p>

<p>If jallikattu is banned, livestock keepers will be forced to abandon the raising of native livestock, which already stands threatened due to the extensive use of motor pumps, tractors and mechanised agriculture. If the sport is banned, it would be the death knell of native cattle species in Tamil Nadu.</p>

<p>We will not only lose our breeds but also our self-sufficiency in milk production as well as promotion of organic farming. If we lose our breeds and import foreign breeds, multinational commercial companies will dominate the dairy industry in India. The livelihood of millions in rural India is at stake here.</p>

<p>People who want a ban on jallikattu are far removed from village life and do not know how this chain works.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court and the Government of India needs to look at the big picture behind jallikattu. The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) supports traditional practices to keep the chain intact and thus enable conservation of native breeds. As an ancient nation with an ancient practice going back millennia, jallikattu should be preserved. There is no torture of any animal of any sort that takes place during the sport and the evidence of this can be seen from live media telecasts. The time a bull spends engaged in the sport is less than 30 seconds. If required, rules can be implemented to enhance the safety of the animals and men if required.</p>

<p>India has already lost many cattle breeds and it can’t afford to lose any more.</p>

<p><strong><em>Rather than banning this event! It would be great great to lay norms and monitor them! Let the Tradition and Our Friends prosper!</em></strong></p>
