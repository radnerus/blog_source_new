      <description>As a kid growing up in Chennai, I literally don&amp;rsquo;t hear about this tradition all through the year, except on Maatu Pongal while flipping through channels I see a bull raging through in the TV. As many, I too wanted to know more about it. But it is postponed to this very day to dig up some facts.
Origin First of all, the name Jallikattu is not the proper one, the original name of the game is YaeruThazhuval (ஏறுதழுவல்) which means bull cuddling/holding or Manju viratuthal (மஞ்சு விரட்டுதல்), later it was changed to Jallikattu(சல்லிக்கட்டு/ஜல்லிக்கட்டு), which means &amp;ldquo;Jalli&amp;rdquo;+&amp;ldquo;Kattu&amp;rdquo;, which refers to the gold or silver coins which will be tied around the bull&amp;rsquo;s neck or on the horns.</description>

      <description>December 23, 2004, still I remember the day when a man with long hair came to the crease, who made me feel sorry for him, after being runout for a duck in his ODI debut. That was the time when many like me wanted a stable wicketkeeper for our team! I was praying him to be the one. He was much more than I ever imagined him 😎. Then came the knock against Pakistan, that magnificent 148 - thanks to DADA for the belief!</description>

      <description>2016 A Hero &amp;amp; A Villan As always, the year started with its own set of twists and turns 😉. All the expectations that I had towards the year were crushed in the first few months one after the other. After all my expectations crushed, I should have stopped there. But I had other ideas, I thought of rising up from the ashes like a Phoenix😎. Its wasn&amp;rsquo;t long, before the Phoenix was kicked to the place it came from 😑.</description>
